[[0krnl]] is the root of trust. this means that apart from being the core, it ensures integrity - which is critical for an operating system meant to be overly secure.
it initializes hardware abstractions and root security mechanisms, and is responsible for starting the secScore calculation via [[0init]]. also the init point for [[0init]] and booting. checks signatures of all modules. manages secure context switches for [[0schd]]. talks to [[0drv]], [[0dev]], and [[0netw]] for security checks. logs kernel events for audit.
