file system manager
works with [[0io]] for device access and [[0memr]] for caching and memory mapping. handles file creation, deletion, read/write, and permissions. keeps track of file metadata and directory structure. checks integrity of files at boot and on access. can mount and unmount storage devices. talks to [[0drv]] for low-level driver stuff.
